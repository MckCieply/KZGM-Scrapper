# KZGM-Scrapper
What it is?
It is a Python Script for Scrapping website and saving it to somekind of database, then look for things that changed between saved and scrapped state and eventually send mail if something changed
Why I made it?
I made it because it was tidious work to regullary check for new proceedings waiting for one particular to show up over an extended period of time
How it works?
It uses BS4 to scrape website, compares scrapped to saved, then uses simple file operations to save it
